    "text": "My goal for this analysis is to explore large amounts of wideband acoustic immitance auditory data using SQL. To accomplish this, I will query the WAI Database and build a dataset that can be used to recreate the Mean Absorbance vs. Frequency figure from Voss’s 2020 article on wideband acoustic immitance. I will use three tables from the database: Measurements - a table containing WAI measurements for each subject and session from several different studies, PI_Info - a table holding logistic details about each study, and Subjects - a table with demographic and other information about each subject across all studies. Using SQL, I will join parts of these tables to compile information from 12 different studies, and plot the mean absorption vs frequency results for each, as in Figure 1 (Voss 2020). Then, I will inspect the 2023 WAI study by Sun et al., and use a similar process to plot and determine discrepancies in mean absorbance by age.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(RMariaDB)\ncon_wai &lt;- dbConnect(\n  MariaDB(), host = \"scidb.smith.edu\",\n  user = \"waiuser\", password = \"smith_waiDB\", \n  dbname = \"wai\"\n)\n\nMeasurements &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"Measurements\")\nPI_Info &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"PI_Info\")\nSubjects &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"Subjects\")\n\n\n-- Join SQL tables into one data frame with info needed for plot\nSELECT Measurements.Identifier,\n        AVG(Absorbance) AS Mean_Absorbance,\n        Frequency,\n        CONCAT(AuthorsShortList, \" (\", Year, \") \", \" N= \", \n                COUNT(DISTINCT SubjectNumber, Ear),\n                \" ; \", Instrument) AS Label\nFROM Measurements\nJOIN PI_Info ON Measurements.Identifier = PI_Info.Identifier\nWHERE (Measurements.Identifier = \"Abur_2014\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Feeney_2017\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Groon_2015\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Lewis_2015\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Liu_2008\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Rosowski_2012\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Shahnaz_2006\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Shaver_2013\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Sun_2016\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Voss_1994\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Voss_2010\" OR\n      Measurements.Identifier = \"Werner_2010\") AND\n      Measurements.Frequency &gt; 200 AND Measurements.Frequency &lt; 8000\nGROUP BY Measurements.Identifier, Frequency, Instrument;\n\n\nhead(ears)\n\n  Identifier Mean_Absorbance Frequency                              Label\n1  Abur_2014      0.07847459   210.938 Abur et al.

Each line appears to follow a similar trend, with low absorbances at low frequencies, increasing to a maximum absorbancy between 2000 and 4000 hz, before dropping back down to low absorbance levels at higher frequencies. Notably, in my plot the Feeney et al. study has much lower absorbances between 1000 and 3000 hz frequencies than all of the other observed studies.

Accordingly, we can see the trend of absorbance increasing with frequency until about 1000 hz. Sun’s study evens out a bit more with maxes somewhat spread out between 1000 and 4000hz and then dropping back down at higher frequencies. According to this plot, the only age group that clearly breaks this trend is the oldest group, 80-89-year-old ears with generally much lower absorbances and a max right near 4000hz. Interstingly, the 70-79 year age group does not show any of this decline, and in fact holds some of the highest mean absorbances across frequencies.\nProcess/Discussion\nAfter gathering data, I began by selecting the studies I wanted to work with, and finding variables I needed to include across tables. All of the label and measurement information for the first plot was contained between the PI_Info and Measurements tables, so I joined selected variables from these and grouped by study and frequency in order to obtain a summarized mean absorbance across each frequency per study to plot. I was then able to recreate Voss’ s figure using ggplot. There were some limitations to this, as some of the numbers in the data were slightly different from what was shown in Voss’s plot. For instance, the number of ears in Werner’s 2010 study was listed as N=267 in her plot, where my plot used 962 ears.\nAfter duplicating this plot as closely as possible, I used similar data wrangling to obtain a table and plot of mean absorbance data by age from the study by Sun et al., 2023. I chose to group age by 10 years to simplify and increase readability. I modeled the plot similarly to Voss’s Figure 1, and it showed a sizable difference in shape and height of the curve for mean absorbances of 80-89 year old ears.\nSources\nVoss SE. Resource Review.

Bush, so I decided to examine which president was mentioned in more NYT Headlines during their respective presidential terms (Clinton 1997-2000 / Bush 2001-2004). To do this, I used regular expressions and string functions to wrangle the data into useful information that could be plotted.\n\nNYTimes &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n \n  # Create a column for year using the date\n  mutate(Year_str = str_extract(Date, \"\\\\D-\\\\d\\\\d\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = str_sub(Year_str, 3, 4))\n\n# Headlines with \"Clinton\" between 1997 and 2000  \nClinton_Headlines &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt;= 97 | Year == \"00\") |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(Title, \"Clinton\")) |&gt;\n  select(Date, Year, Title) |&gt;\n  mutate(President = \"Clinton\")\n\n# Headlines with \"Bush\" between 2001 and 2004\nBush_Headlines &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  filter(Year &lt;= 04, Year != \"00\", Year != \"05\", Year != \"06\") |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(Title, \"Bush\")) |&gt;\n  select(Date, Year, Title) |&gt;\n  mutate(President = \"Bush\")\n\n# Join these two together to plot\nBoth_Headlines &lt;- full_join(Clinton_Headlines, Bush_Headlines) |&gt;\n  group_by(President, Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(num_headlines = n())\n\n# bar chart\nggplot(Both_Headlines, aes(x = fct_rev(President), \n                           y = num_headlines, \n                           fill = fct_relevel(Year, \n                                              c(\"97\", \"98\",\"99\", \"00\", \"01\", \"02\", \"03\", \"04\")))) + \n  geom_col() + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels=c('Clinton (1997-2000)', 'Bush (2001-2004)')) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Clinton v Bush: Which President Had More Headlines During Their Term?\",\n    x = \"President\",\n    y = \"Number of Mentions in NYT Headlines During Term\",\n    fill = \"Year\"\n  ) + \n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the number of New York Times headlines that each president was mentioned in during their consecutive terms (Bill Clinton 1997-2000 and George W. Bush 2001-2004) by year. Based on the plot, there is clearly a large difference in both the total number of headlines for each president, where Bush had a total of 65 headline mentions between 2001 and 2004 and Clinton only had 20. There does not seem to be a consistent pattern of increase or decrease of headlines by year during a presidential term. Notably, Bush had a huge surge of headlines in 2001 which is likely due to the influx of New York Times articles around the crisis of 9/11. It would be interesting to look at whether there was also a large difference in the total number of New York Times articles in this data set between 1997-2000 and 2001-2004 that might confound these results.\nAnother question of interest was whether the typical number of words per headline varied by month, and if this relationship changed depending on whether the headline contained punctuation.\n\nNYTimesWM &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  # extract month from date as new variable\n  mutate(Month = str_extract(Date, \"(?&lt;=-).+(?=-)\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(word_list = str_split(Title, \" \")) |&gt;\n  mutate(num_words = lengths(word_list)) |&gt;\n  # variable for whether headline contains punctuation\n  mutate(Punctuation = grepl(\"[[:punct:]]\", Title))\n\n\n# boxplot  \nggplot(NYTimesWM, aes(x = fct_relevel(Month, c('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar',\n                                               'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',\n                                               'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep',\n                                               'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec')), \n                      y = num_words, color = Punctuation)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Length of New York Times Headlines by Month \n    With and Without Punctuation Between 1996 and 2006\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of Words Per Headline\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the distributions of the number of words per headline for each month for headlines with and without punctuation. By month, the distributions do not show a clear trend, but the ranges for February and November with punctuation appear to be the largest overall excluding outliers, while May has both the longest headline (largest outlier) and one of the shortest, at one word. However, looking at the comparison between headlines with punctuation and headlines without punctuation, the ranges for headlines with punctuation show higher word counts for every single month, and there are also far more outliers on the high end for this category. In fact, the upper quartile for headlines with punctuation is a larger number of words for every month except August, which is even with no punctuation. These results are understandable considering that longer sentences are more likely to need punctuation in order to have proper grammar. The months with the largest difference between punctuation and no punctuation in median number of words per headline are September and November."

This data was originally scraped from www.sports-reference.com into a Kaggle dataset by RGriffin, and contains bio and medal results information on athletes from the 1896 Athens games through Rio 2016.\nI have selected six sports from the dataset: swimming, gymnastics, equestrianism, diving, weightlifting, and speed skating, with the intent to explore how the average age of Olympic participants varies by sport and how that has changed over time, using visuals.\nAn example of the data can be seen below.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 7\n   name                                year sport        team    age event medal\n   &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 \"Christine Jacoba Aaftink\"          1988 Speed Skati… Neth…    21 Spee… &lt;NA&gt; \n 2 \"Christine Jacoba Aaftink\"          1988 Speed Skati… Neth…    21 Spee… &lt;NA&gt; \n 3 \"Christine Jacoba Aaftink\"          1992 Speed Skati… Neth…    25 Spee… &lt;NA&gt; \n 4 \"Christine Jacoba Aaftink\"          1992 Speed Skati… Neth…    25 Spee… &lt;NA&gt; \n 5 \"Christine Jacoba Aaftink\"          1994 Speed Skati… Neth…    27 Spee… &lt;NA&gt; \n 6 \"Christine Jacoba Aaftink\"          1994 Speed Skati… Neth…    27 Spee… &lt;NA&gt; \n 7 \"Einar Ferdinand \\\"Einari\\\" Aalto\"  1952 Swimming     Finl…    26 Swim… &lt;NA&gt; \n 8 \"Arvo Ossian Aaltonen\"              1912 Swimming     Finl…    22 Swim… &lt;NA&gt; \n 9 \"Arvo Ossian Aaltonen\"              1912 Swimming     Finl…    22 Swim… &lt;NA&gt; \n10 \"Arvo Ossian Aaltonen\"              1920 Swimming     Finl…    30 Swim… Bron…\n\n\nThen, I wrangled the data to find the average age of athletes from each year and selected sport. Note that not all of these sports were part of the Olympics in 1896, so average values only appear for the years that the sport was contested in the Olympics.\n\n# calculate average age in each sport by olympic year, to be plotted\nolympics_plot &lt;- olympics |&gt;\n  group_by(year, sport) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nhead(olympics_plot, 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n# Groups:   year [3]\n    year sport         avg_age\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1896 Gymnastics       24.3\n 2  1896 Swimming         18.7\n 3  1896 Weightlifting    22.2\n 4  1900 Equestrianism    38.9\n 5  1900 Gymnastics       22.2\n 6  1900 Swimming         21.8\n 7  1904 Diving           23.7\n 8  1904 Gymnastics       25.1\n 9  1904 Swimming         22.9\n10  1904 Weightlifting    23  \n\n\nThen, I created a plot of this data of year vs average age, separating each sport into a different colored line.\n\nggplot(olympics_plot, aes(x = year, y = avg_age, color = sport)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Age of Olympic Participants by Sport\",\n    x = \"Olympic Year\", \n    y = \"Average age of Participants\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nFrom this plot, we can see that the average age of Equestrian Olympians has been consistently 5+ years greater than the averages of the other five sports shown between 1890 and 2010. Notably, where most sports saw a large increase in average age between the late 1800s and early 1900s, equestrianism shows a large decrease in average participant age during these years.\nAmong the other sports, swimming consistently had the lowest average age of competitors, until Gymnastics surpassed it in the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, weightlifting has average ages of its Olympians most consistently on the high end, but still nowhere near the equestrian average.\nOverall, there does not appear to be a very strong relationship between year and average age of Olympic participants that is consistent across these sports, except an all-around dip in age around 1980.\nLink to Data: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-08-06"

    "text": "In this project, I will use data from the June 2024 “Cheese” folder from the TidyTuesday github repository. This data was originally scraped from cheese.com, which contains information on 2,041 specialty cheeses from over 74 countries across the world. The dataset contains many cheeses, along with the animal and region they come from, and information about the color, texture, rind type, flavor, and aroma of the cheese.\nI have looked specifically into rind type and color, in order to explore which rind types are most common, and how this relates to the color of the cheese, using visualizations.\nAn example of the data can be seen below.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  cheese             milk  country     rind    color       flavor  texture aroma\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Aarewasser         cow   Switzerland washed  yellow      sweet   buttery butt…\n2 Abbaye de Belloc   sheep France      natural yellow      burnt … creamy… lano…\n3 Abbaye de Belval   cow   France      washed  ivory       &lt;NA&gt;    elastic arom…\n4 Abbaye de Citeaux  cow   France      washed  white       acidic… creamy… barn…\n5 Abbaye de Tamié    cow   France      washed  white       fruity… creamy… perf…\n6 Abbaye de Timadeuc cow   France      washed  pale yellow salty,… soft    nutty\n\n\n\ncheeses |&gt;\n  na.omit() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rind, color = color)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Cheese Rind Count by Color\",\n    x = \"Rind Type\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nFrom this plot, we can clearly see that a “natural” rind is by far the most common rind type among cheeses in this dataset. Artifical, edible, and plastic rinds seem to be much less common. For most of the rind types, it appears that white and yellow are the most prominent colors of cheese. However, pale yellow is the most common among natural rinds and thus also very common overall. There are very few blue-grey or brown colored cheeses. I used “color” instead of “fill” to differentiate between colors because the large amount of different colors made it very difficult to see the difference between colors without sharp lines in between.\nSince it is difficult to get a lot of information from this plot, I thought it might be interesting to look at how cheese colors vary across countries of origin. There ended up being too many countries to display on a single plot, so I selected the five countries with the most cheeses: Australia, Canada, France, Italy, and the US.\n\ncheeses |&gt;\n  na.omit() |&gt;\n  filter(country %in% c(\"Australia\", \"Canada\", \"France\", \"Italy\", \"United States\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = country, color = color)) +\n  geom_bar() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nThis plot more clearly shows a variation in cheese color depending on the country. The chart shows a much higher total count United States cheeses, of over 200 cheeses. The others have between 25 and 100 types of cheese. Australia, France, and Italy most commonly have white cheeses, while the United States has more pale yellow cheeses. Canada displays relatively equal numbers of white, pale yellow, golden yellow, and cream cheeses. The high proportion of US pale yellow cheeses, as well as the high cheese count leads me to wonder if the United States cheeses make up most of the natural rind cheeses shown in the first plot.\n\ncheeses |&gt;\n  filter(country == \"United States\") |&gt;\n  group_by(rind) |&gt;\n  summarize(rind_num = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(rind_num)) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  rind         rind_num\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1 natural           124\n2 rindless           44\n3 &lt;NA&gt;               41\n4 bloomy             32\n5 mold ripened       21\n6 washed             21\n\ncheeses |&gt;\n  filter(rind == \"natural\") |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  summarize(natural_num = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(natural_num)) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  country                                natural_num\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                        &lt;int&gt;\n1 United States                                  124\n2 Italy                                           83\n3 France                                          51\n4 Ireland                                         14\n5 Austria                                         13\n6 England, Great Britain, United Kingdom          12\n\n\nWrangling the data, we do in fact find that natural rinds make up for 124 of the 305 United States cheese types, and that the United States contains by far the highest number of cheeses with natural rinds.\nLink to Data: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-06-04"
