(I have selected 6 sports from the data for readability purposes.)\nCode:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nolympics &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-08-06/olympics.csv')\n\n\nselected_sports &lt;- filter(olympics, sport == \"Swimming\" | sport == \"Gymnastics\" | sport == \"Equestrianism\" | sport == \"Diving\" | sport == \"Weightlifting\" | sport == \"Speed Skating\")\n\nnew_olympics &lt;- selected_sports |&gt;\n  group_by(year, sport) |&gt;\n  mutate(avg_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(new_olympics, aes(x = year, y = avg_age, color = sport)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Age of Olympic Participants by Sport\",\n    x = \"Olympic Year\", \n    y = \"Average age of Participants\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nFrom this plot, we can see that the average age of Equestrian Olympians has been consistently 5+ years greater than the averages of the other five sports shown between 1890 and 2010. Notably, where most sports saw a large increase in average age between the late 1800s and early 1900s, equestrianism shows a large decrease in average participant age during these years.\nAmong the other sports, swimming consistently had the lowest average age of competitors, until Gymnastics surpassed it in the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, weightlifting has average ages of its Olympians most consistently on the high end, but still nowhere near the equestrian average.\nOverall, there does not appear to be a very strong relationship between year and average age of Olympic participants that is consistent across these sports, except an all-around dip in age around 1980.\nLink to Data: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-08-06"
