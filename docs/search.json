It reports the results of an experimental study conducted in 2017 by Lin Bian that tested whether some children were more likely to choose someone of their own gender when asked to identify a “smart” or “nice” individual in an image. The stereotype variable gives the proportion of trials where each child chose a gender target that matched their own gender. I will focus specifically on trials where the children were shown images of adults and asked to point out the person who appeared to be smart, and compare results between the male and female genders.\nMy research question: Are young females less likely to identify adults of their own gender as smart than young males?\n\ngender_stereo &lt;- children_gender_stereo[[\"2\"]]\n\nstereo_obs &lt;- gender_stereo |&gt;\n  filter(trait == \"smart\", target == \"adults\") |&gt;\n  group_by(gender) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_stereotype = mean(stereotype)) |&gt;\n  mutate(difference = mean_stereotype[gender == \"male\"] - mean_stereotype[gender == \"female\"]) |&gt;\n  pull(difference)\n\nstereo_obs\n\n[1] 0.09722222 0.09722222\n\n\nHo: μfemale = μmale (μmale - μfemale = 0) Ha: μmale - μfemale &gt; 0\n\nsimulate_choices &lt;- function(rep, num_tests) {\n  \n  female_choices &lt;- sample(c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), size = num_tests, replace = TRUE)\n  male_choices &lt;- sample(c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), size = num_tests, replace = TRUE)\n  return(mean(male_choices) - mean(female_choices))\n}\nset.seed(47)\nnum_exper &lt;- 5000\ndistribution &lt;- map_dbl(1:num_exper, simulate_choices, num_tests = 144)\n\n\n# p-value\nsum(distribution &gt;= stereo_obs) / num_exper\n\n[1] 0.013\n\n\n\n# visualize null sampling distribution\ndistribution |&gt;\n  data.frame() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = distribution)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = stereo_obs, color = \"red\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Sampling Distribution when Ho is True\",\n    subtitle = \"aka no difference between gender picks\",\n    x = \"mean difference in proportion of stereotype by gender\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot displays the null sampling distribution of\nSource:\nBian L, Leslie SJ, Cimpian A. 2017. “Gender stereotypes about intellectual ability emerge early and influence children’s interests”.

Bush 2001-2004) by year. Based on the plot, there is clearly a large difference in both the total number of headlines for each president, where Bush had a total of 65 headline mentions between 2001 and 2004 and Clinton only had 20. There does not seem to be a consistent pattern of increase or decrease of headlines by year during a presidential term. Notably, Bush had a huge surge of headlines in 2001 which is likely due to the influx of New York Times articles around the crisis of 9/11. It would be interesting to look at whether there was also a large difference in the total number of New York Times articles in this data set between 1997-2000 and 2001-2004 that might confound these results.\nQuestion 2: Does the typical number of words per headline vary by month? Does this relationship change depending on whether the headline contains punctuation?\n\nNYTimesWM &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  # extract month from date as new variable\n  mutate(Month = str_extract(Date, \"(?&lt;=-).+(?=-)\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(word_list = str_split(Title, \" \")) |&gt;\n  mutate(num_words = lengths(word_list)) |&gt;\n  # variable for whether headline contains punctuation\n  mutate(Punctuation = grepl(\"[[:punct:]]\", Title))\n\n\n# boxplot  \nggplot(NYTimesWM, aes(x = fct_relevel(Month, c('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar',\n                                               'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',\n                                               'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep',\n                                               'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec')), \n                      y = num_words, color = Punctuation)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Length of New York Times Headlines by Month \n    With and Without Punctuation Between 1996 and 2006\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Number of Words Per Headline\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the distributions of the number of words per headline for each month for headlines with and without punctuation. By month, the distributions do not show a clear trend, but the ranges for February and November with punctuation appear to be the largest overall excluding outliers, while May has both the longest headline (largest outlier) and one of the shortest, at one word. However, looking at the comparison between headlines with punctuation and headlines without punctuation, the ranges for headlines with punctuation are longer for every single month, and there are also far more outliers on the high end for this category. In fact, the upper quartile for headlines with punctuation is a larger number of words for every month except August, which is even with no punctuation. These results are understandable considering that longer sentences are more likely to need punctuation in order to have proper grammar. The months with the largest difference between punctuation and no punctuation in median number of words per headline are September and November."

Notably, where most sports saw a large increase in average age between the late 1800s and early 1900s, equestrianism shows a large decrease in average participant age during these years.\nAmong the other sports, swimming consistently had the lowest average age of competitors, until Gymnastics surpassed it in the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, weightlifting has average ages of its Olympians most consistently on the high end, but still nowhere near the equestrian average.\nOverall, there does not appear to be a very strong relationship between year and average age of Olympic participants that is consistent across these sports, except an all-around dip in age around 1980.\nLink to Data: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-08-06"
